gSurf is a Python application for the geological analysis of structural surfaces.
In the current version (0.1.2) it calculates the intersections between a geological plane, expressed through its dip direction, dip angle and 'source point', and a DEM.
The resulting intersections can be saved as a point shapefile or as a line shapefile (experimental code).
These shapefiles can be viewed and further processed in GIS software such as Quantum GIS or Saga.
