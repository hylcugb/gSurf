gSurf is a Python application for the geological analysis of structural surfaces.
In the current 0.1.2 version it calculates the intersections between a DEM and a geological plane, 
expressed through its dip direction, dip angle and 'source point' (i.e., a point located on the geological plane
and corresponding for instance to an outcrop of this plane).
The resulting intersections can be saved as a point shapefile or as a line shapefile (experimental code).
These shapefiles can be viewed and further processed in GIS software such as Quantum GIS or Saga.
